# The-Bugtacker
A bug tracking system or defect tracking system is a software application that keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.

Typically bug tracking systems are integrated with other project management software. A major component of a bug tracking system is a database that records facts about known bugs. The main benefit of a bug-tracking system is to provide a clear centralized overview of development requests, and their state.
